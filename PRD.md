PRD: Personal Website – Part 2 (Content & Layout)
Objective

Create a clean, minimalistic personal website that highlights About and Work sections with clear indexing for navigation. The design should mimic the simplicity of dris.one with IBM Plex Mono as the default font and a fully centered layout.

This page will serve as the main portfolio landing page. Blogs are excluded in this version.

Features
1. Typography & Layout

Default font: IBM Plex Mono (Google Fonts).

Font usage:

Headings, subheadings, body, and navigation all use IBM Plex Mono for consistency.

Alignment:

All content should be fully centered, both horizontally and vertically aligned to look balanced.

Minimal styling:

Black text on a white background.

Minimal use of colors (blue for links, light gray for subtle separators if needed).

No heavy borders, shadows, or background distractions.

2. Navigation / Index (Table of Contents)

A right-hand side index (like the documentation screenshot you provided).

Links in the index scroll smoothly to the corresponding section.

Sections included:

About

Work

Experience (sub-index)

Projects (sub-index)

3. Content Structure (placeholders)

About Section

Placeholder for introduction text.

Example: “I’m Arnav, a Computer Science student at …”

Work Section

Experience Subsection

Placeholder text (for roles, internships, etc.).

Projects Subsection

Placeholder text (for portfolio projects).

4. Responsiveness

Mobile:

Index collapses into a top menu (hamburger or inline links).

Desktop:

Index remains pinned to the right side, vertically aligned with sections.

5. Design Inspiration

Modeled after dris.one → plain, centered, strong typographic focus.

No heavy navigation bar at the top; instead, rely on index links.

Content sections are stacked vertically and clearly separated with whitespace.
